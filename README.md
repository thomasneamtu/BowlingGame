This is a 3D short and sweet bowling game


This was my first ever project created with Unity while in a game development course.

I thought this little fun game would be a lovely addition to my portfolio to see the growth I have begun since the beginning of my game development journey.

I learned how to import assets, how to make the ball roll down the lane with coding using C#
and how to restart the game cycle, creating my first game and learning so much about Unity and Coding with such a small project.

Enjoy!
